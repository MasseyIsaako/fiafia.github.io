When setting up your camera, it’s good to make sure that your camera is steady and still. If your camera moves around too much, it can affect your video’s quality of sound and picture.</p><p>A tip to help get the best angle for your video is by recording horizontally so that your camera has a more widened view.</p>",

For example, if your item is singing a song, make sure that your camera is positioned at a distance where we can hear your wonderful voice(s)! If you are deciding to play a separate supporting instrumental while you sing your song, try to find the proper balance of volume between the music and your voice so that neither sound gets overshadowed by the other. These tips also apply for those who may be playing an instrument while they sing, and for those preparing other types of items as well! Furthermore, no matter what your item may be, if you are talking/singing in your video, it helps when you try your best to project your voice so that we as the audience don’t miss a single part of your lovely item. :-)</p>",

A tip that helps to create better lighting is recording with your flash on (if your camera has one), and/or setting up a light behind or next to your camera as you record. If you are recording during the day, another thing that helps is by opening up your blinds to create a more natural set of lighting when preparing your item.</p><p>Another way to create the perfect atmosphere is by limiting potential distractions if possible in your video. One tip to help regarding this topic is to examine your background for your item and making sure that there are no probable disturbances. This tip also applies to dressing for success and eliminating any unwanted noise that can be included in your video. In doing so, it is much appreciated and will help those in the audience to be able to get the full enjoyment in your wonderfully prepared item!</p>",
